Save your paper as a Microsoft Word .doc or .docx file. Make sure the “track changes” feature is turned off. Make sure the View is at 100%. Before submitting, be sure that when you open the file, there are no unfinished changes or comments that display in the document.

General Order of Manuscript Pages
Cover Page
The cover page contains the paper title and abstract ONLY. Do NOT display author names or any information about the authors anywhere in the manuscript.

The Body of Your Paper
The first page of the manuscript for review is the beginning of the text and includes the title of the paper but no author information. The body of the text is to be double spaced. All pages except the abstract page are numbered consecutively at the bottom, right hand corner of the page. The references are inserted after the main body of the paper.

*Insert Tables and Figures in the body of the paper where they best fit in the discussion. Avoid tables or figures being split between pages.

Specific Guidelines for Submitted Manuscript
Title: manuscript titles should be no longer than 12 words, centered on the page, 12 point Times Roman, in bold type. Do not capitalize first letter of words like of, to, a, an, for, and so on. For example:

How to Teach Finance in a Modern Classroom

Abstract: the abstract must not exceed 200 words, left justified, 12 point Times Roman, in regular font. Do not include citations in the abstract.

First section of paper will most always be INTRODUCTION

Section headings: there are three acceptable section headings with special formatting:

• First level section: all caps and bolded (e.g., INTRODUCTION); left justified
• Second level section: Cap Only First Letter of Each Word and Bold Heading (e.g., Review of Literature); left justified. Do not capitalize the first letter of words like of, to, a, an, for, and so on.
• Third level section: Cap only first letter of each word and Italicize heading (e.g., Model Design); left justified. Do not capitalize first letter of words like of, to, a, an, for, and so on.

Do not use footnotes or endnotes anywhere in the paper. If the information is important enough, insert it in the main text.

Last section of the paper should be REFERENCES. Use APA style for all references. For example:

Smith, J., Chung, J., & Gomez, J. (2014). How to Teach Finance in a Modern Classroom. Journal of Financial Education, 48(2), 33-51.

A good website that will create APA formatted references is:

Tables and Figures. Tables and Figures are titled as:

Table 1: Analysis of Student Responses
Figure 1: Diagrammatic Channels of Authority

Size of table. All tables should be single spaced. Use font size of no less than 9 pt. if that is required to fit your table on a single page.
